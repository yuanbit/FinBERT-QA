# FinBERT-QA: Financial Question Answering using BERT
FinBERT-QA is a Question Answering system for retrieving opinionated financial passages from task 2 of the [FiQA](https://sites.google.com/view/fiqa) dataset. Please see [FinBERT-QA: Financial Question Answering with pre-trained BERT Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00725) for further information.

The system uses techniques from both information retrieval and natural language processing by first retrieving the top-50 answer candidates of each query using the Lucene toolkit, [Anserini](https://github.com/castorini/anserini), then re-ranking the answer candidates using variants of pre-trained [BERT](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.04805.pdf) models. 

Built from Huggingface's [transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) library and applying the Transfer and Adapt [[TANDA](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.04118.pdf)] method, FinBERT-QA first transfers and fine-tunes a pre-trained BERT model to a general QA task, then adapts this model to the financial domain using the FiQA dataset. The transfer step uses the fine-tuned BERT model on the [MS MACRO Passage Retrieval](https://microsoft.github.io/msmarco/) dataset from [Nogueira et al.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.04085.pdf), where it was converted from a TensorFlow to a PyTorch model.

The [state-of-the-art](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3184558.3191830) results were improved by an average of ~20% on three ranking evaluation metrics (nDCG, MRR, Precision).

```
Overview of the QA pipeline:

1. The Anserini Answer Retriever first retrieves the top-50 candidate answers
2. A pre-trained BERT model is first transferred to the large-scale MS MACRO dataset
3. The transfered BERT model is then adapted to the target FiQA dataset to create the Answer Re-ranker
4. The final Answer Re-ranker outputs the top-10 most relevant answers

## Installation
If no GPU is available, an alternative and low-effort way to train and evaluate the models as well as predicting the results is through the following [online notebooks](https://github.com/yuanbit/FinBERT-QA-notebooks) using Colab.

### With Docker
This repo can be used as a container with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/). This is does not require a locally checked out copy of FinBERT-QA. Run the commands as root if Docker is not configured.

#### Docker pull command
```
docker pull yuanbit/finbert_qa:3.0
```
#### Run
Run with GPU.
```
docker run --runtime=nvidia -it yuanbit/finbert_qa:3.0
```
## Quickstart
Run to query the top-k opinionated answers from the financial domain
```
python3 src/predict.py --user_input --top_k 5
```
Sample questions:
```
• Getting financial advice: Accountant vs. Investment Adviser vs. Internet/self-taught?
• Are individual allowed to use accrual based accounting for federal income tax?
• What are 'business fundamentals'?
• How would IRS treat reimbursement in a later year of moving expenses?
• Can I claim mileage for traveling to a contract position?
• Tax planning for Indian TDS on international payments
• Should a retail trader bother about reading SEC filings
• Why are American Express cards are not as popular as Visa or MasterCard?
• Why do companies have a fiscal year different from the calendar year?
• Are credit histories/scores international?
```

## Retriever
The retriever uses the BM25 implementation from [Anserini](https://github.com/castorini/anserini). To replicate the creation of the Lucene index for the FiQA dataset run the following inside the docker image:
```
cd retriever
git clone https://github.com/castorini/anserini.git
sh indexer.sh
```
## Dataset
The [raw dataset](https://sites.google.com/view/fiqa) has been cleaned and split into training, validation, and test sets in the form of lists where each sample is a list of ```[question id, [label answer ids], [answer candidate ids]]```. The datasets are stored in the pickle files in ```data/data_pickle```. The generation of the datasets can be replicated by running the ```src/generate_data.py``` script, more details please see [Generate data](#generate-data). ```data/data_pickle/labels.pickle``` is a pickle file consisting of a python dictionary where the keys are the question ids and the values are lists of relevant answer ids.

Since creating inputs to fine-tune a pre-trained BERT model can take some time, sample datasets are provided in ```data/sample/``` for testing.

Example QA pair:
```
Question: Why are big companies like Apple or Google not included in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) index?

Answer: That is a pretty exclusive club and for the most part they are not interested in highly volatile companies like Apple and Google. Sure, IBM is part of the DJIA, but that is about as stalwart as you can get these days. The typical profile for a DJIA stock would be one that pays fairly predictable dividends, has been around since money was invented, and are not going anywhere unless the apocalypse really happens this year. In summary, DJIA is the boring reliable company index.
```
